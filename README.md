Augmented Reality Sandbox Project
----------------------------------
This will be the single source for all software.
Inside this directory I will be cloning the open source libfreenect.
The purpose of which will be to test the existing hardware against known working software.

The next step will be to complete the calibration on our setup. 
That involves getting the exact dimensions captured for the sandbox and the exact distances
from the base to the Kinect V1 sensor.

Once that is completed, I will then be writing my own.
